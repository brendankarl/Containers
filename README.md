# Containers #
Some sample Containers that I've created whilst learning Containers, Docker and Python (a perfect combination!)

- **WorkoutGenerator** - Creates a workout with 8 random exercises (from a list of 26).
- **WorkoutGenerator - Docker Compose** - Uses Docker Compose to create two containers: Web (Flask) and DB (MySQL). A list of exercises is stored in database hosted on DB.
